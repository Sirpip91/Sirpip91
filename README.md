# Hello, I'm [Bradley](https://github.com/Sirpip91) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a C++ Programmer, Web Enthusiast, and a Computer Science enjoyer.

My work primarily involves Programming and developing software for business needs during the day, and contributing to the field of computer science during the night.

## ðŸš€ My Work 
My work is primarily involved in programming, although I focus mainly on providing knowledge and removing the "over-complicating" parts of teaching.

### Bradleydallen.io
This is my main full project. It will contain tutorials, blogs, courses, and everything involving computer science. The main goal and focus of this project is to provide informational value to users without the "fluf". Computer science topcis usually include large "nomenclature" that causes confusion within the field. <br>

My purpose with this site is to provide valuable information and tutorials without the overcomplication of being "smarter" than others.

I implement the layman's approach to teaching:
